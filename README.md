# FrameWork

I used java as my programming language in my framework.

I used Selenium to automate my browsers.

Maven as my built automation tool. which has pom.xml file that allows me to manage my dependencies.

Page Object Model to simplify managing and maintaing.

Singleton Design Pattern.

configuration.PROPERTIES type of file where i have stored Browser type, username/password and url.

BDD approach to simplify reading and understanding my framework.

Wrote my test cases as if they are Scenarios using Gherkin Language in the Feature Files.

Implemented the actual coding logic inside of my step_definitions package.

I trigger my framework from my runner class.
(Runner class allows me to run different types of testing suites that I created with my tags) (CukesRunner)
